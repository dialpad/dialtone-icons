# Releasing

## Requirements to run `semantic-release`, which is used in this guide https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#requirements

`semantic-release` uses the commit messages to determine the consumer impact of changes in the codebase. 
In Dialtone icons we use [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) for commit messages, so semantic-release automatically determines the next semantic version number, generates a changelog and publishes the release.

| Commit Type                 | Release type  |
|-----------------------------|:-------------:|
| Commit with breaking change | Major release |
| Commit with type feat       | Minor release |
| Commit with type fix        | Patch release |
| Commit with type perf       | Patch release |

## Steps

In order to push the `main` branch to deploy the documentation site and/or trigger a release to [npmjs](https://npmjs.com) and GitHub Releases, you will need to either be an admin of the Dialtone icons repository, be a user with the "Maintain" role or have manually been given permission on your user.

### Production release:

1. Make sure your `staging` and `main` branches are up-to-date locally.
2. Checkout to `staging` branch.
3. Stop your local server and keep your working directory clean before versioning.
4. In your CLI window, run `npm run release` from the Dialtone repository directory.
5. If there are changes that should trigger a release:
   - The script will update the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files with the version number according to the types of changes introduced since the last release and will add release notes in the `CHANGELOG.MD` file. 
   - A release commit and a git tag associated with this commit will be created and pushed to the remote.
6. We are ready to deploy the release. Switch to the `main` branch: `git checkout main`.
7. Merge the release commits from `staging` using [`fast-forward` strategy](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#Documentation/git-merge.txt---ff-only): `git merge staging --ff-only`.
8. If the commits merged correctly, we can now push to the remote: `git push`.
9. GitHub Actions will now deploy a new release of Dialtone icons to npm.
10. You should be able to see your deployment running at [Dialtone icons GitHub actions](https://github.com/dialpad/dialtone-icons/actions).
11. When the GitHub Actions have been completed, the version of the package deployed to GitHub releases and npm.
12. Now youâ€™re ready to update your projects to use the latest Dialtone icons version ðŸŽ‰.
    - Use `npm install @dialpad/dialtone-icons` to install the latest version.

### Vue 3 Release:

1. If you wish to make a vue 3 release follow the exact steps above except substitute `staging` for `staging-vue3` and `main` for `vue3`.


### Pre-release (`alpha` or `beta`):

1. Create a feature branch off staging, commit your changes.
2. Merge your feature branch to `beta` or `alpha`.
   - **Note**: If there are many merge conflicts, it's ok to delete `beta` or `alpha` branch
   and recreate it from your feature branch.
3. Checkout to `beta` or `alpha` branch.
4. Push to the remote: `git push`.
5. Stop your local server and keep your working directory clean before versioning.
6. In your CLI window, run `npm run release` from the Dialtone repository directory.
7. If there are changes that should trigger a release:
   - The script will update the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files with the version number according to the types of changes introduced since the last release and will add release notes in the `CHANGELOG.MD` file. 
   - A release commit and a git tag associated with this commit will be created and pushed to the remote.
8. Since your pre-release branch was pushed to the remote, the deployment GitHub Action should have been triggered.
9. Merge the release you have made on `beta` or `alpha` branch into your feature branch, so you have the release commit in sync:
   - Replace `$FEATURE_BRANCH` with your feature brdialtonanch name and `$RELEASED_BRANCH` with the branch name you have released `beta` or `alpha`:
      ```
      git checkout $FEATURE_BRANCH
      git merge --ff-only $RELEASED_BRANCH
      ```
10. Push to the remote: `git push`.
11. You should be able to see your deployment running at [Dialtone GitHub actions](https://github.com/dialpad/dialtone-icons/actions).
12. When the GitHub Actions have been completed, the new version of the package should have been deployed to GitHub releases and npm.
13. Now youâ€™re ready to update your projects to use the recently deployed Dialtone icons version ðŸŽ‰.
    - Use `npm install @dialpad/dialtone-icons@alpha` to install the latest alpha. 
    - Use `npm install @dialpad/dialtone-icons@beta` to install the latest beta.
